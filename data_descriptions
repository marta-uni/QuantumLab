data 1 directory 25.10.24
  scope_0 : almost aligned cavity
  scope_1 : Maximized the first peak of the first group
  scope_2 : maximized the first peak of the second group
  scope_4: heated the cavity so that a full free spectral range was visible

data 2 directory 29.10.24
  10 data collections without realigning anything at first
  scope_0 - scope_9

data 3 directory 29.10.24
  10 data collections after having slightly realigned 
  scope_10-scope_19

data 4 directory 05.11.24
  11 data collections after having completely ruined alignment and having partially recovered it
  scope_0-scope_11

data 5 directory 08.11.24
  11 data collections after having further aligned the system and removing downsampling from oscilloscope settings
  laser temperature was 23.790 °C
  scope_5-scope_15

data 6 directory 12.11.24
  scope_0 to scope_4, scope_10, scope_11 : data collections with different number of samples, we ended up taking
  data with 65000 samples per file
  scope_15 to scope_25: 11 data collections adjusting piezo range and laser current in order to span 2 free spectral ranges
  laser temperature was 23.790 °C
    scope_15 to scope_20 had 49.484 mA of laser current, piezo range was 15 Vpp, with offset -2.5V
    scope_21 had 48.951 mA of laser current, piezo range was 15 Vpp, with offset -2.5V
    scope_22 to scope_25 had 49.484 mA of laser current, piezo range was 15 Vpp, with offset -1V
