data from 4 channel oscilloscope was taken at 65°C of cell temperature and 36.9°C of diode temperature
fixed piezo 0:  piezo had -2.280V offset
                amplitude of modulation was 340mVpp
                offset of modulation was -20mVpp
                I DON'T KNOW ZERO POINT OF CURRENT MODULATION, AS IN THE PICTURE I CAN ONLY SEE A VALUE WITH RUNNING INSTRUMENT
fixed piezo 1:  offset of piezo was -1.280Vpp
                amplitude of modulation was 340mVpp
                offset of modulation was -30mVpp
